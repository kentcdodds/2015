# angular-formly, Abstracting Away Complexity

## Description

We're all really tired of writing the same code for every form. You need a label here and an input
here and make sure their IDs are the same and unique and now you want me to add validation!? Daah!
I got fed up with this pretty quick and found that I enjoy writing JavaScript a lot more than
repeating myself with HTML. If you're like me, then you'll love angular-formly. In this talk, we'll
see how you can very easily represent your model with a form using a few lines of JavaScript. You
want validation, conditional fields, or custom templates? You need to react to changes to a field?
Piece of cake. Oh, and are you worried about the upgrade path to Angular 2.0? Let's talk...
So come on, and let's make forms less painful and more delightful.
